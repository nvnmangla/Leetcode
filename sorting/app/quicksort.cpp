/** @brief Worst Case vs Average Running Time
                • Worst-case running time of quicksort is Θ(𝑛 ! ) – worse than
                  heapsort and merge sort.
                • However, it is very efficient on average – its expected running
                  time is Θ(𝑛lg𝑛), with small constant factors.
                • This usually makes quicksort the best practical choice for sorting.
